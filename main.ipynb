    "\n",
    "Financial fraud  happens when someone takes money or other assets from you illegally, and there are many different types types such as identity, payment, account takeover, etc. Especially due to the growing banking system and the financial technologies, we would like to research and learn more into what could be used to determine whether a transaction is fraud or not, and which category(ies) would be more important than others for detection.\n",

    "- merchant_category: business category involved in transaction [retail, travel, online, utilities, entertainment, etc...]\n",
    "- location: location from where transaction was initiated\n",
    "- device_used: device type used [mobile, web, atm, pos]\n",
    "- is_fraud: boolean flag indicating whether the transaction was fraudulent [true, false]\n",
    "- spending_deviation_score: deviation from normal spending pattern\n",
    "- velocity_score: number of transactions over a recent period\n",
    "- geo_anomaly_score: measure of unusual geographic transaction behaviour [0, 1]\n",
    "- payment_channel: card, ACH, wire_transfer, UPI\n"
