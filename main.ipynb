    "Financial fraud  happens when someone takes money or other assets from you illegally, and there are many different types types such as identity, payment, account takeover, etc. Especially due to the growing banking system and the financial technologies, we would like to research and learn more into what could be used to determine whether a transaction is fraud or not, and which category(ies) would be more important than others for detection.\n",

    "- merchant_category: business category involved in transaction [retail, travel, online, utilities, entertainment, etc...]\n",
    "- location: location from where transaction was initiated\n",
    "- device_used: device type used [mobile, web, atm, pos]\n",
    "- is_fraud: boolean flag indicating whether the transaction was fraudulent [true, false]\n",
    "- spending_deviation_score: deviation from normal spending pattern\n",
    "- velocity_score: number of transactions over a recent period\n",
    "- geo_anomaly_score: measure of unusual geographic transaction behaviour [0, 1]\n",
    "- payment_channel: card, ACH, wire_transfer, UPI\n"

The variables transaction_id, timestamp, sender_account, receiver_account, ip_address and device_hash provide arbitriary technical details, making it unlikely for these variables to be as helpful for detecting a fraud transaction.\n",

However, this dataset has multiple categorical variables, so we first need to make these into indicator variables. This is essential, as it converts categories into a binary variable, making linear regression possible with these variables. We will use the `get-dummies` function from the Pandas library to do this."
